# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

This repository is mainly used to record my completed and ongoing data analysis projects which are mainly from reputable online learning platforms, including Coursera, Kaggle, Forage, etc.

With expert guidance from the platform, I acquired the ability to clean and organise data and discover patterns and insights through analytical output and visualisation. Ultimately combining all the information to draw meaningful conclusions for decision making. It also prepared me for a career as a data analyst.

## Project 1: Analyse ANZ Bank's credit and debit cards usage
A set of ANZ Bank's card transfer records was given, covering 23 sets of variables and over 12,000 rows of transfer records from 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions from different locations, age group, etc. The objective of Project 1 is to simulate realistic transaction behaviours and patterns based on the hypothetical customers records. 

## Project 2: Target new customers and broader market segment for a bike company
A set of existing customer demographics, purchase history together with new customer list were provided. The new customer list consists of 1,000 individuals with their personal information, such as gender, age, job industry, etc. The main purpose of this project is to analyse existing customer spending records and based on the buying behaviour and patterns to target new customers and market segments.

## Project 3: Design market strategies to increase customer loyalty
Twelve months of bike sharing data were collected. The data contains 13 variable and over 5 millions row of riding records in Chicago. The company's riders are mainly classified as casual and annaul member. The higher management and financial analyst of the company believe that the company's future growth is highly relying on the number of annual members. The main purpose of the project is to analyse bike sharing trends and design marketing strategies to increase the number of annaul member.

## Project 4: Analyse global power plant and the impact on climate change
This open source dataset was obtained from Kaggle and it covers all power stations and major power generation sources in 164 countries around the world. As electricity generation can come from both renewable and non-renewable sources, an analysis of the main sources of electricity generation currently in use around the world gives us an idea of the contribution of the electricity sector to climate warming in each country and the consequences to social, economy and environment.

## Project 5: Examine COVID-19 cases and vaccination program in Malaysia (in progress)
COVID-19 cases and vaccination program datasets are collected from the Github of the Ministry of Health Malaysia. The COVID-19 cases dataset includes new cases, recovered cases, etc and breakdown into different age group, vaccination status and location, while vaccination program dataset covers number of daily vaccinations for different age group. The main purpose of this project is to understand the current COVID-19 situation and vaccination progress in Malaysia.
